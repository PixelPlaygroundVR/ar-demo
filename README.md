"Jack into the grid, runner. Forge your dream studio in a neon-drenched dystopia where tech deals burn bright and AR visions materialize."
Welcome to Pixel Syndicate, the ultimate cyberpunk web app that fuses savage tech deals with mind-bending AR visualization. Built for the iPhone 16 Pro Max and beyond, this isn’t just a tool—it’s a portal to a digital underworld where you sculpt studio setups, hack them into reality, and dominate the creative grid. Think Tron meets The Matrix, with a dash of Nashville swagger.
Features That Rip the Grid Apart
Neon Deals: Snipe bleeding-edge tech—VR rigs, quantum mics, holo shades—at slashed prices with glitchy, animated cards.
Cyber Packages: 50 unique bundles auto-generated with a 15% discount, each a bespoke arsenal of gear ready to deploy.
AR Overdrive: Step into WebXR-powered AR to place 3D studio setups in your space, complete with a pulsating neon grid, interactive controls, and a holographic assistant spitting cryptic quips.
Immersion Maxed: Dynamic code rain, ambient synth beats, hover effects, and device-tilt responsiveness—every pixel screams cyberpunk.
Order Uplink: Transmit your order through a slick modal, logged to the console like a data heist confirmation.
Tech Stack
HTML5: Structure for the digital sprawl.
CSS3: Neon glows, glitch effects, and responsive grids.
JavaScript: Animations, interactivity, and code rain chaos.
A-Frame (WebXR): AR magic via CDN for lightweight deployment.
No Dependencies: Pure, standalone power—runs anywhere with a browser.
Getting Started
Jack into the Syndicate in minutes. Here’s the uplink protocol:
Prerequisites
A modern browser (Safari, Chrome) with WebXR support for AR.
An iPhone 16 Pro Max or similar device for the full experience (desktop works too, minus AR).
Audio files (hover.mp3, cyberpunk-bg.mp3) and 3D models (vr-headset.glb, etc.) in sounds/ and models/ folders.
Installation
Clone the Repo:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PixelSyndicate.git
cd PixelSyndicate
Add Assets:
Drop mock or real audio files into sounds/ (e.g., from freesound.org).
Add GLTF 3D models to models/ (e.g., from Sketchfab or create in Blender).
Use placeholders if needed (e.g., "https://via.placeholder.com/300x200?text=Item" for images).
Run Locally:
Install a local server: npm install -g live-server.
Launch: live-server.
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
Deploy (Optional):
Push to GitHub Pages:
Commit all files: git add . && git commit -m "Initial uplink" && git push.
Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings (Settings > Pages > Source: main branch).
Access at https://yourusername.github.io/PixelSyndicate.
Usage
Browse: Scroll through deals and packages—hover for sound, click AR buttons to hack into your space.
Visualize: In ar.html, move your device to place models, use controls to rotate/scale, and ping the assistant for sass.
Order: Hit an order button, fill the modal, and transmit your payload to the grid (console log).
Demo
URL: https://yourusername.github.io/PixelSyndicate (Update after deployment)
AR Tip: Point your iPhone camera at a flat surface, grant permissions, and watch the neon grid pulse to life.
Roadmap
API Integration: Swap mock deals for real-time tech steals (e.g., Amazon API).
Payment Grid: Add Stripe for jacking in real creds.
Custom Models: Let users upload their own 3D setups.
Multiplayer Hack: Collaborative AR studio design with peers.
